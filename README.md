# Timetable

## Hey, what is this tool for?

* Might be useless but I am making for fun. This will be convert your csv formatted timetable file to html.

## Input files

* Input must consist of two files.
  1. Configuration (A YAML file?)
   * Start/end time for each day
   * Length of the slot 
  2. Items
   * Day
   * Start/End time
